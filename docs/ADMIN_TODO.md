## üéØ QUICK START GUIDE

### Admin Portal Focus:
**What Admin CAN do:**
- View and manage all users
- Approve/reject merchants
- Verify KYC documents
- Review and approve properties
- Handle disputes between users and merchants
- Monitor platform security
- Configure platform settings

**What Admin CANNOT do (Merchant Portal handles):**
- View/manage bookings
- Process payments
- Issue refunds
- Booking calendar management

### To begin implementation:

1. **Choose your strategy** (A, B, or C above)
2. **Start with Week 1 - User Management**:
   - Create UserDetailScreen.js (view/edit user details)
   - Create KYCVerificationScreen.js (approve merchant KYC)
   - Test both screens thoroughly
3. **Move to Week 2 - Merchant Property Management**:
   - Create PropertyApprovalScreen.js (review properties)
   - Create PropertyDetailScreen.js (view property details)
4. **Update navigation** in AppNavigator.js
5. **Create API endpoints** as documented
6. **Test with real data**

### Development Tips:
- Reuse components from merchant screens
- Follow existing design system in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- Use mock data initially
- Test each screen before moving on
- Update this TODO as you progress
